Weâ€™ve been growing tremendously these past few weeks, and are looking to add at least three new moderators, four if possible. If you\\'re interested, please keep reading!\\n\\nSo, what does it mean to be a moderator on /r/iphone? Well, several things. It is important that anyone who applies be ACTIVE and MATURE in their duties as a mod. All mods should frequently check /new and remove any posts that break the rules (or anything else that might need to be removed). All mods should make sure discussions in popular threads adhere to the rules as well. The more time you have, the better. You could be perfect for the role, but someone who only has an hour to spare won\\'t fit the part. You will be expected to be active, and if you are not active or is inactive after a few weeks of being active without a solid reason, you will be removed as a mod. \\n\\n## Requirements\\n\\n* Your account must be at least *6 months old* and you must have at least *500 cumulative karma*.\\n* Must be active on /r/iPhone and have a history of contributing positively to the subreddit (i.e. not breaking rules and not coming here to troll).\\n* Look forward to doing the \"janitorial\" work that is the bulk of what moderators do: removing and approving posts, clearing the modqueue, responding to modmail, helping people, maintaining order. \\n* Willing to perform the majority of moderation work from a computer &amp; install Moderator Toolbox (mod tools for mobile are terrible).\\n* Have a Discord account, and if selected as a mod, be in the r/iphone Discord channel for staff chat.\\n* Be extremely active in doing your mod duties, and be mature in interactions with users and other mods.\\n* Previous moderator experience is helpful, but not necessary.\\n\\nPlease be honest in your answers on the mod application form, don\\'t write an application that embellishes or fabricates -- we want to know the real you. Each applicant will receive the same level of consideration, but we might be more inclined to bring on people who are more active, regardless of timezone.\\n\\nIf you are selected, you will be on a trial basis, and if you do not perform up to standard, you would be removed as a mod. This would not generally be done unless you are extremely inactive, or do something extraordinarily bad against the sub and site rules, so be rest assured that it is not going to happen that easily.\\n\\n**Link to the form: [The /r/iphone Moderator Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_8Vi_jCp4ozqaS1oP6Q3RMaSNwOM6wHRFsxjD0BislA/viewform).**\\n\\nWe can only take a handful of people, so if you aren\\'t chosen, please don\\'t take it personally. The application will be closed in a few weeks, or whenever we feel that the number of applicants is more than enough, whichever comes first. Successful applicants will be contacted shortly after that.\\n\\nGood luck to everyone! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them below and we will respond to your queries.',\n",
